 [x] Consider the bias in orderbook samples (centered at the lowest ask price) in the algorithm generating synthetic samples.
 [x] Remove obsolete PriorityModeCount
 [x] Refactor selection of priority samples by using relative distribution tail values rather than absolute ones
 [x] In TkTImeSeriesForecasterTraining - change legend 'Accuracy' to 'KL-Div'
 [x] Make price history input in time series model to be discrete and use min_price_step of a share as a discretization value.
 [ ] Rename PriorityTailThreshold to PriorityTailMeanThreshold
 [ ] Generate orderbooks in reduced range { random(-width/2,0) ... random(0,width/2) } to improve likelihood to the real orderbooks with large min_price_step
 [ ] TimeSeriesPreprocessor should shift the last trades samples in input history according to the pivot price
 [ ] Try residual layers in time series prediction
